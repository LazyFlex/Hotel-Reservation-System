## Hotel Reservation System

Welcome to the Hotel Reservation System project! This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based application for a small hotel chain, allowing potential customers to easily reserve rooms based on availability. Below, we describe the key features and technologies used in this project:

### Features

1. **Form Validation:** Ensure seamless data collection from customers by implementing both front-end validation using JavaScript and back-end validation using PHP. This ensures that only valid and complete submissions are accepted.
    
2. **Responsive Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, making the reservation system accessible across various devices. This ensures a consistent and optimal user experience.
    
3. **Server-Side Logic:** Implement robust server-side logic using PHP, with the option to utilize Laravel for enhanced functionality. This allows for efficient handling of business logic and interaction with the database.
    
4. **Read Data from Text File:** Develop functionality to read room details from a text file, including room number, capacity, and rate. This feature populates the reservation system with accurate room information.
    
5. **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to a relational database (e.g., MySQL) using PHP, and store customer information and booking details securely. This ensures reliable data storage and retrieval.
    
6. **Composer and Twig Integration:** Utilize Composer as a dependency management tool and implement Twig to manage views effectively. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing layout across all pages of the application.
    
7. **Security:** Adhere to best practices for handling user data and database connections securely. This includes password hashing, input validation, and protection against SQL injection attacks, ensuring the safety of user information.
    
8. **SEO Compatibility:** Enhance search engine visibility by addressing SEO compatibility essentials, such as proper use of meta tags, keyword placement, alt text for images, and creation of a robots.txt file.
    
9. **Weather Forecast Integration:** Implement a feature that utilizes a public [Web API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide weather forecast information for the location of the hotel. This feature assists guests in planning their stay better by providing up-to-date weather forecasts.
    
10. **JavaScript  Implementation:** Enhance the user experience with  JavaScript to provide dynamic updates to available rooms based on selected dates. This feature ensures a smooth and seamless reservation process without page refreshes.
